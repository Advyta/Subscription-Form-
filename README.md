## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

Additional personal challenge:

- Store a subscriber's information including the selected plans and add ons on mongoDB.
- Send an email on the user's email Id confirming subscription and details of the selected plans and addons (using nodemailer and mailtrap).
- Delete all the information of a subscriber when they unsubscribe.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 6 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Advyta/Subscription-Form.git
    cd Subscription-Form
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
### Running the Application

1. Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add your environment variables. Environment variables consist of 
- A secret token string
- A mongodb connection string in the format of 
  ```
  mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<CLUSTER>.mongodb.net/<DATABASE>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  ```
- Mailtrap username and password which is used to check the email sent to the subscriber
:

    ```env
    TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    MAILER_USER=your_user_from_mailtrap
    MAILER_PASSWORD=your_password_from_mailtrap
    ```
1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## My process

### Built with

- Nextjs 14
- Tailwind css
- Typescript
- React Hook Form
- Mongoose
- Nodemailer and Mailtrap

### What I learned

- Deepened my understanding of Next.js and its features
- Enhanced my TypeScript skills
- Improved my ability to manage state using Context API
- Gained experience in form validation with React Hook Form

### Continued development

I plan to extend this project by:
- Adding unit tests and integration tests for testing components and API routes to ensure the functionality is as expected.
- Improve the email sent to the subscriber and include the unsubscribe option in the email itself.
